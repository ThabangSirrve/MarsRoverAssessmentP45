# MarsRoverAssessmentP45

# Running the Project 
 -A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.
 - This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers 
    so that their on board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth
 - The project is cross platform and requires .net core 2.2 SDK
  
#Assumptions 
 - The terrain has only positve numbers i.e x >= 0 and y >= 0
 - Rover cannot explore outside the Pleteau
